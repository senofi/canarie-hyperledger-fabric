# Hyperledger Fabric Starter Package
Sample Solution of a Hyperledger Fabric Network, chaincode and web applications.

CANARIE DAIR Sample Solution

Prerequisites for this solution to work are Docker, Docker Compose and Git.

## How to Get Started

### Locally

Steps to run on a Linux machine (the solution has been tested on Ubuntu):
- Run ./scripts/install-bins.sh
- Go to folder "fabric-network"
- Run the following commands:
  - ./network.sh down
  - ./network.sh up -ca
  - ./network.sh createChannel -c trial
  - ./network.sh deployCC -ccn cctest -ccp ../clinical-trials-chaincode/ -ccl java -c trial
  - IMAGE_TAG=main docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose-web-apps.yaml up -d
  - docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose-hlf-explorer.yaml up -d
  - docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose-nginx.yaml up -d

### Vagrant

The sample solution could be installed locally using a [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) virtual machine (VM). The default provider that Vagrant relies on is [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/). Make sure that both of them are installed locally before proceeding.

To get the VM up and running simply run `vagrant up` in the root folder. This will run the default branch set up (main). To run against a specific branch run `BRANCH=<branch-name> vagrant up`.

### Cloud Provider

We support Canarie DAIR Cloud and you can find more information on our BoosterPack and others [here](https://www.canarie.ca/cloud/boosterpacks/).
The only limitation for any other cloud provider is that the operating system is Ubuntu 20.04 or above.
