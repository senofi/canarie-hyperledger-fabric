# Hyperledger Fabric Starter Package
Sample Solution of a Hyperledger Fabric Network, chaincode and web applications.

CANARIE DAIR Sample Solution

Prerequisites for this solution to work are Docker, Docker Compose and Git.

Preliminary steps to run on a Linux machine:
- Run ./scripts/install-bins.sh
- Go to folder "fabric-network"
- Run the following commands:
  - ./network.sh down
  - ./network.sh up -ca
  - ./network.sh createChannel -c trial
  - ./network.sh deployCC -ccn cctest -ccp ../clinical-trials-chaincode/ -ccl java -c trial
  - docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose-web-apps.yaml up -d
  - docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose-hlf-explorer.yaml up -d

Open 3 browser tabs and use the credentials for the web apps: user/pass

- http://localhost:8088/ - create a case as a hospital representative
- http://localhost:8089/ - investigate a case as a pharma processor
- http://localhost:8090/ - see the status as regulator
- http://localhost:8080/ - HLF blockcahin explorer (credentials: admin/adminpw)


Assume we have a javascript chaincode in folder ../../fabric-samples/asset-transfer-basic/chaincode-javascript/

# How to Get Started

## Locally

The sample solution could be installed locally using a [Vagrant|https://www.vagrantup.com/] virtual machine (VM). The default provider that Vagrant relies on is [VirtualBox|https://www.virtualbox.org/]. Make sure that both of them are installed locally before proceeding.

To get the VM up and running simply run `vagrant up` in the root folder.

## Cloud Provider

We support Canarie DAIR Cloud and you can find more information on our BoosterPack and others [here|https://www.canarie.ca/cloud/boosterpacks/].
The only limitation for any other cloud provider is that the operating system is Ubuntu 20.04 or above.
